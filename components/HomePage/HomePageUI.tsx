          Menopause symptoms â€“ namely hot flushes and night sweats - are common
          after cancer treatment. They can impact negatively on your quality of
          life. There may be treatment that can reduce the impact of these
          symptoms.

          Cancer Centre have developed this web-based app to help cancer
